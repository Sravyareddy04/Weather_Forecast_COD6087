## Setup

### 1. Set Up API Key
To fetch weather data, you'll need to set up an API key from an online platform (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

#### Steps:
1. Go to the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) or another weather API provider of your choice.
2. Create an account and generate your API key.
3. Open the script.js file in the project.
4. Find the line where the API key is set:

    javascript
    const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
    

5. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key.
6. Save the file and refresh your browser.

## How It Works
1. The user enters a city name in the search bar.
2. The JavaScript code makes a request to the weather API using the entered city name.
3. The API returns weather data.
4. The data is displayed on the web page, including:
   - Temperature
   - Humidity
   - Weather condition
   - Wind speed
